Important Conceptual Points 

1. Writes to all the flip-flops happen @posedge of clock
2. reset of any flip-flop can happen asynchronously
3. enable signal on the memories : should be high for any memory operation to take place.
    NOTE : enable is NOT the write-enable for the memories


-------------------------------------------------
1. flush in the id/ex pipeline ??
2. pc_wen in pc register
3. halt_not_flush
4. writing to the register happens at clock
5. writing to zero register in stall updates flags 
6. tmp_instr is redundant in IF/ID pipe
7. what does the memory 'enable' signal do ?





// ---- TODO ----

1. Remove flush_in from if_id_pipe
